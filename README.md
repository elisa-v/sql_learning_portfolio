# 📊 SQL Learning Portfolio

This repository documents my progress in learning **SQL for Data Science and AI Engineering**.  
The goal is to master SQL fundamentals, practice on different platforms, and prepare for applying SQL in **data pipelines, analytics, and ML/AI workflows**.

---

## 🚀 Learning Path and Progression

- **Mode Analytics SQL Tutorial**
  - ✅ Basic SQL (SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, LIMIT, operators) → *done*
  - ✅ Intermediate SQL (Joins) → *done*
  - ⏳ Advanced SQL (Window functions, Subqueries) → *in progress*
- **Kaggle SQL Micro-Course** → Applied SQL on real-world datasets → *done*
- **LeetCode SQL Problems** → Interview-style query practice (to be added).  

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Build a strong foundation in SQL (basic to advanced).
- Practice queries across multiple platforms (Mode, SQLBolt, Kaggle, LeetCode).
- Develop problem-solving skills for data science & AI 
- Apply SQL in data pipelines, feature engineering, and MLOps projects.

## ▶️ How to Use This Repo

The queries and notebooks in this repository were created and tested across different platforms:

- **mode_sql_basic** and **mode_sql_intermediate**  
  All SQL queries in these folders were written and tested using **[Mode Analytics](https://mode.com/)**.  
  To run them yourself:
  1. Create a free account on [Mode Analytics](https://mode.com/).
  2. Open the **SQL Editor** (Mode Studio).
  4. Copy-paste queries from this repo into the editor.
  5. Run them to view results and optionally build charts in the Report Builder.


- **kaggle-sql**  
  Jupyter notebooks in this folder were written and run as part of the Kaggle course:  
  👉 [Intro to SQL](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-sql).  

  These notebooks run directly on Kaggle using their built-in **BigQuery integration** and sample datasets.  
  If you’d like to try them out:

  1. Open the linked course on Kaggle.  
  2. Copy the code into your own Kaggle Notebook, or run the provided `.ipynb` notebooks from this repo.  
  3. Modify queries and re-run cells to explore variations.
